    Your fee is based on the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet your-answers">
    <li>Type of tax: Income tax (e.g. PAYE, self-assessment)</li>
    <li>Type of dispute: Penalty or surcharge</li>

  </p>
  <h2 class="heading-medium">Your fees</h2>
  <p>
    To submit your appeal you will need to pay an initial fee of
    <strong>£<span data-key="fee">20</strong></span>
    for the tribunal to process your case. You will need to pay this once you have entered your appeal or application details.
  </p>
  <p>
    In cases like yours, there is typically no need for a hearing in person and there will be <strong>no further fees</strong> to pay.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    The tribunal judge is independent of government and will listen to both sides of the argument before making a decision. They also have the power to decide whether you should be reimbursed for any costs including your tax tribunal fees.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the tribunal rejects your appeal or the judge decides not to award you costs, you will not be able to claim back any tax tribunal fees.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">What's the next step</h2>
  <p>
    Check if you’re in time to make an appeal to the tax tribunal or whether you need to give reasons why you’re appealing late.
