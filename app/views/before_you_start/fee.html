  <p>
    Unless you are eligible for <a class="external" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a> you will have to pay the initial fee to HM Courts & Tribunals Service after entering details for your case.
  </p>
  <p>
  Further fees apply if your case needs further documents, correspondence and a hearing in person with a judge.

  <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens if you are successful</h2>
  <p>
    The judge is independent and has the power to decide whether your fees are refunded by the unsuccessful party. The tribunal itself does not have the power to enforce or award costs.
