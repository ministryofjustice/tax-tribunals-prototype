        If you accepted or asked for a review, you should wait until it ends or allow 45 days before appealing. Your appeal risks being rejected if a review is ongoing.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>HMRC will tell you on the original notice letter how you can query or challenge a tax decision.</p>
          <p>You usually have 30 days to write to them saying why you think their decision is wrong.</p>
          <p>It is free to ask HMRC to look into your tax issue again. You will usually only have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or any professional advice.</p>
          <p><strong>You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after challenging HMRC</strong>
          <p>HMRC will send you a letter telling you their view on your tax dispute and whether they've changed their mind.</p>
          <p>If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can:
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>ask HMRC for a review by an officer who wasn’t involved in the original decision. You can still appeal to the tax tribunal afterwards if you do not accept the review conclusion or your review hasn't finished after 45 days</li>
            <li>consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</li>
            <li>appeal to an independent tax tribunal within 30 days</li>
          </ul>
          <p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-appeals">guidance from HMRC on how to appeal</a> against a tax decision.</p>
