      <p>The judge is independent of government and has the power to decide whether your fees are refunded by the unsuccessful party. The tribunal itself does not have the power to enforce or award costs.</p>
      <p>Check if you're able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">get help paying your fees</a> if you’re on a low income or receiving certain benefits.</p>
