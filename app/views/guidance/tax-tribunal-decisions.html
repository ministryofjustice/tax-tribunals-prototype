            <h2 class="heading-large">6. Tax tribunal decisions</h2>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">The decision on your case</h3>
            <p>You will receive your impartial decision from the tax tribunal in writing:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>if you didn’t have a hearing the decision will be based on the appeal form and other paperwork</li>
              <li>
                if you had a hearing you may get a decision on the day but usually you will hear:
                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                  <li>within 1 month if your case was straightforward</li>
                  <li>within 2 months if your case was more complicated and involved principles of law or large sums of money</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">If either party withdraws</h3>
            <p>If either party withdraws before the judge reaches a decision, the judge has the power to decide whether the withdrawing party should pay costs or refund any tax tribunal fees.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">If you win your case</h3>
            <p>If you win your case, the judge has the power to decide whether the losing party should pay costs or refund your tax tribunal fees.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">If you lose your case</h3>
            <p>If you lose your case, you will not receive a refund of your tax tribunal fees.</p>
            <p>If you do not accept the independent decision made by the judge, you can ask for the decision to be ‘set aside’ or ask for permission to appeal.</p>

            <h4 class="heading-small">Get a decision set aside</h4>
            <p>You can ask for a decision to be ‘set aside’ (cancelled), but only if you think there was a mistake in the process. The letter you get with the decision will tell you how to do this. Contact <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm">Citizens Advice</a> if you need help.</p>

            <h4 class="heading-small">Ask for permission to appeal</h4>
            <p>You may be able to appeal against the decision if the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) made a legal mistake, e.g. it didn’t:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>apply the law correctly</li>
              <li>fully explain its decision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>1. Ask for full written reasons if you haven’t had them already. You must do this within 28 days of the date on the decision notice - the decision notice will tell you how.</p>
            <p>2. Ask for permission to appeal - <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=4505">download the appeal form and read the guidance notes</a>. You must do this within 56 days of the date given on the full written reasons.</p>
            <p>Send the appeal form to:</p>
            <p>First-tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber)<br>
              PO Box 16972<br>
              Birmingham<br>
              B16 6TZ </p>

            <h4 class="heading-small">After you send the form</h4>
            <p>A judge will decide if you can take your case to a higher tribunal, called the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery). <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-upper-tribunal">Appeal to the Upper Tribunal</a> if you get permission.</p>

            <h4 class="heading-small">If you’re refused permission to appeal</h4>
            <p>You can apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal if the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) refuses, or only gives you permission to appeal on limited grounds.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Previous decisions</h3>
