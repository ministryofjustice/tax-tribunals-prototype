            <h2 class="heading-large">3. Tax tribunal fees</h2>
            <p>You will need to pay an initial fee of £20, £50 or £200 to submit an appeal or application to the tribunal unless you're eligible for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a>.</p>
            <p>Your initial fee contributes towards the cost of processing your case. You may also have to pay a further fee to cover costs if your case needs further documents, correspondence and a hearing in person with a judge.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">How much does an appeal cost</h3>
            <p>You can find an overview of appeal and application costs in the table. See the <a href="#">Tax Tribunal Fee Guide (T2XX)</a> for a full list of all tax tribunal fees.</p>

            <p>You will have to pay your initial fee to HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) when you submit details for your case.</p>
            <p>Check before you start your appeal whether you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">get help paying your fees</a> if you’re on a low income or receiving certain benefits.</p>
            <p class="notice util_mt-large">
              <i class="icon icon-important">
                <span class="visuallyhidden">Warning</span>

                You will need to submit the correct documents and pay an initial fee for your appeal to proceed.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>You can pay tax tribunal fees by:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>credit or debit card, if you are submitting an appeal online</li>
              <li>authorised account, if you have an account set-up with HMCTS</li>
              <li>cheque, if you are submitting your appeal by post</li>
              <li>help with fees reference number, if you have successfully applied for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Claiming a refund</h3>
            <p>The judge is independent of government and has the power to decide whether your fees are refunded. The tax tribunal itself does not have the power to enforce or award costs.</p>
